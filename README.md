# AR-Based Navigation Assistance System for the Visually Impaired

## Overview
This project presents an augmented reality (AR) based assistive navigation system designed to support visually impaired individuals during indoor and outdoor navigation. The system focuses on real-time obstacle awareness and environment understanding using computer vision and AI techniques, with guidance delivered through non-visual feedback.

The work was developed as an academic research prototype and documented through a detailed project report. The research was accepted and presented at an academic conference.

## Problem Statement
Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating unfamiliar environments due to the lack of real-time spatial awareness and obstacle detection. Traditional assistive tools provide limited contextual information and often fail in dynamic environments.

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system integrates:
- Real-time camera input for environmental perception
- AI-based object and obstacle detection
- Augmented reality processing for scene understanding
- Audio-based guidance to assist safe navigation without visual dependency

The system aims to enhance user independence and situational awareness.
